I am a **physicist**, (scientific) **software developer**, and **drummer**.

Currently, I am persuing a **PhD** in mathematics at the University Of Bern with a focus on numerical analysis.
I am especially interested in solving
non-linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by means of variational energy reduction techniques
on adaptive finite element (FEM) spaces.

I have formerly worked as a research assistant at the [Eastern Switzerland University Of Applied Sciences](https://www.ost.ch/en/)
in the
[Scientific Computing & Engineering team](https://www.ost.ch/en/research-and-consulting-services/technology/renewable-energies-and-environmental-engineering/iet-institute-for-energy-technology/scientific-computing-engineering)
, where I was involved in the set-up and automation of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and the maintenance of the in-house cluster.
I have experience both with [STAR-CCM+](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/simcenter/fluids-thermal-simulation/star-ccm/)
and the open-source project [OPENFOAM](https://openfoam.org/).

Also, I have worked as a C++/Python software developer at [Meteomatics AG](https://www.meteomatics.com/)
, where I was mainly involved in the implementation of the weather API and performance optimizations thereof.

As a drummer, I am both part of the Band [Kaufmann](https://kaufmannmusik.ch/) and [Happy For Real](https://www.happyforreal.ch/).
